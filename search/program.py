    This is the entry point for your submission. You should modify this
    function to solve the search problem discussed in the Part A specification.
    See `core.py` for information on the types being used here.

    Parameters:
        `board`: a dictionary representing the initial board state, mapping
            coordinates to "player colours". The keys are `Coord` instances,
            and the values are `PlayerColor` instances.  
        `target`: the target BLUE coordinate to remove from the board.
    
    Returns:
        A list of "place actions" as PlaceAction instances, or `None` if no
        solution is possible.
    """

    # The render_board() function is handy for debugging. It will print out a
    # board state in a human-readable format. If your terminal supports ANSI
    # codes, set the `ansi` flag to True to print a colour-coded version!
    print(render_board(board, target, ansi=True))

    # Do some impressive AI stuff here to find the solution...
    # ...
    # ... (your solution goes here!)
    # ...

    # Here we're returning "hardcoded" actions as an example of the expected
    # output format. Of course, you should instead return the result of your
    # search algorithm. Remember: if no solution is possible for a given input,
    # return `None` instead of a list.
